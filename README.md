# Summary

This repository was made to help categorize the study of Statistics and to work as an archive for me to come back to later on. This is a work in progress and will take some time before all the fields and every topic is completely reviewed.

# How it Works


The exercises are solved using the language **Python** and libraries such as *Numnpy*, *Matplotlib* and *Seaborn*. The programming was done on Jupyter Notebook and the files are in the format .ipynb. The instructions are as follow:

- Every Chapter is divided by folders. Some of the folder are listed below:
  - [Linear Algebra](https://github.com/isaiapedro/math-study/tree/linear-algebra)
  - [ODEs and Series](https://github.com/isaiapedro/math-study/tree/odes-and-series)
  - [Calculus](https://github.com/isaiapedro/math-study/tree/calculus)
- On each chapter you'll find a .ipynb file and a readme.md file. The readme contains an introduction to all the concepts talked about on the chapter and the .ipynb file will contain the code used to solve the exercises.
- To run the solution, you can pull or download the zip files of the current folder and run the notebook on *VSCode* or the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/).
- You can also suggest new changes on [GitHub issues](https://github.com/isaiapedro/math-study/issues) or by creating a pull request with your suggested changes.

### Conclusion

Thanks for reading up until here. I hope that this repo helps you to study this book and have a better understanding of Statistics and Probability.
