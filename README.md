# Summary

The repository was made to categorize the study of Statistics and to work as an archive for me to come back to later on. This is a work in progress and will take some time before all the fields and every topic is completely reviewed.

# How it Works


The exercises are solved using the language **Python** and libraries such as *Numpy*, *Matplotlib* and *Seaborn*. The programming was done on Jupyter Notebook and the files have the format .ipynb. The instructions are as follows:

- Every Chapter is divided by folders. Some of the folders are listed below:
  - [Chapter 1](https://github.com/isaiapedro/statistics-study/tree/main/chapter1)
  - [Chapter 2](https://github.com/isaiapedro/statistics-study/tree/main/chapter2)
  - [Chapter 3](https://github.com/isaiapedro/statistics-study/tree/main/chapter3)
- On each chapter you'll find a .ipynb file and a readme.md file. The readme contains an introduction to all the concepts talked about on the chapter and the .ipynb file will have the code used to solve the exercises.
- To run the solution, you'll have to pull or download the files of the current folder and run the notebook on *VSCode* or the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/).
- You can also suggest new changes on [GitHub issues](https://github.com/isaiapedro/statistics-study/issues) or by creating a pull request with your suggested changes.

### Conclusion

Thanks for reading up until here. I hope that this repo will help you study the book and have a better understanding of Statistics and Probability.

Any issues can be addressed on the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/isaiapedro/statistics-study/issues) and hopefully I can help you soon enough.
